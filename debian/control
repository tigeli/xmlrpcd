Description: XML-RPC over HTTPs daemon/client
 This is small XML-RPC server, that supports HTTPs and HTTP authentication. It
 doesn't need any big HTTP server, such as Apache or lighttpd.
 .
 Main goal was to provide easy-to-setup RPC daemon, that supports X.509/SSL
 (for traffic protection) and optional authentication.
